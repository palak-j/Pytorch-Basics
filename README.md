# Pytorch-Basics

Pytorch is based on torch an is one of the most popular deep learning libraries. <br/>
Developed by: Facebook AI research team. <br/>

Written in Python, CUDA, C++. <br/>
PyTorch is similar to NumPy in the way that it manages computations, but has a strong GPU support. <br/>

PyTorch is a library for processing tensors. A tensor is a fundamental unit of data. It can be a number, vector, matrix, or any n-dimensional array. It is similar to Numpy arrays. <br/>

This repository has the basic functions on Tensors including creating tensors, converting array to tensor, dot product  etc.
